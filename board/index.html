			Hey ISCAO! My name is Emaan and I am a senior at UC Davis majoring in Civil Engineering. It is my immediate pleasure to announce to you that this year, we have one of the most amazing and hardest working boards this club has ever seen. I am confident that together, we will hold fun and memorable events, both social and cultural, that will surely raise your expectations towards your fellow Persian community members.

			Dorood bar shoma (hello), present and future ISCAO members! I am a 3rd year International Relations and Economics major with the future goal of attending law school. However, my life-long aspiration has been to spread the knowledge (and the fun) of Iranian culture! I hope to familiarize Iranian diaspora and non-Iranians alike with Iranian culture; I also desire to satiate the nostalgic appetites of Iranians away from home. ISCAO is a warm and welcoming family that extends beyond the boundaries of UC Davis or graduating UC Davis. We would be delighted if you took part in our events and the expansion of our family! Be omideh didar (hope to see you soon)!

			My name is Parnya Baradaran and I am a Sophomore studying Computer Engineering at UC Davis. As the Co-Cultural Coordinator for ISCAO, I hope to create a unique experience for my community through activities like Shabe Sher, Shabe Yalda and even Hokm nights! I absolutely love every aspect of being Persian, from speaking Farsi everyday, to traveling to Iran with my family, and to learning how to cook Gheyme(my favorite Persian dish!). I am honored to be a part of ISCAO. Lets show Davis what being Persian is all about!

			Greetings ISCAO! My name is Sanam Monjazeb and I am a third year pre-law student at UCD. I'm from Orange County and some of my interests are playing the piano, taking pictures, and going hiking. I am very excited to be your treasurer this year as we have numerous events planned for you. My goal this year is to integrate as many Iranians in Davis together as we possibly can. Feel free to contact me via email/facebook if you have any questions or suggestions, and get pumped for an exciting year!

        Hello ISCAO!
        My name is Yasaman Mahboub and I'm a Biological Sciences &ndash; Pre-dental &ndash; major at UC Davis.
        I migrated to the U.S. four years ago, and ever since, I couldn't distance myself an inch from my Persian
        heritage. This is why I joined ISCAO, and I'm grateful to be your Norooz Show Coordinator this year.
        I look forward to producing an entertaining night while introducing Persian New Year traditions
        and portraying Iran’s rich art, music, dance, and poetry.
        Hope to see you there.

        Salam everyone!<br>
        My name is Kimya Baradaran and I am a first-year pre-med student
        here at UC Davis. Even though I was born here, I feel that I am
        a true Persian at heart. I believe that Persians are some of
        the most kind, friendly, and fun-loving people in the world.
        I also believe that the members of ISCAO are not only part of
        a club, but also part of a team and family who support each
        other and have fun together. I am honored to be a part of
        ISCAO, and am looking forward to all the memories we will
        create together.

			SALAAAAAAAM!<br>
			My name is Mahsa Naderi. I am a sophomore studying Nutrition Science here at UC Davis, and will serve as your Financial/Fundraising Coordinator for the 2013-2014 year. I am extremely thrilled to be part of this amazing club and look forward to organizing many wonderful events for you guys this year. I was born and raised in Iran (Esfahan), moved to the Bay Area when I was 12 years old, and have been very involved in Persian communities ever since. I joined ISCAO as a freshman because of the friendly atmosphere it offers, attended their events, and built lasting friendships. I have gained a lot of fun experiences through this organization, and hope you will too! WELCOME TO ISCAO!! :)

			My name is Anahita Yazdi and I am a fifth year mechanical engineering student. I chose this major since I have a strong passion in aerospace and space exploration. I was born in Mashhad, Iran and came here when I was 15. My parents moved to Fair Oaks (in Sacramento county) and lived there since. I play some piano and enjoy listening to music. I like all genres all the way from classical to country. I have two younger brothers and a little cat. I decided to join ISCAO this year so that I can get more involved and promote my Persian community.
